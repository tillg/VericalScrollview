# VericalScrollview
The code used in the explanatory video of Marco Almeida

When trying to make a UIScrollbar work in a project, I found this very helpful tutorial. In order to be able to compare what Marco built and what my project had (mainly the constraints), I needed the code of his demo. So I followed strictly his video and reproduced the code.

Feel free to use it in order to better understand the constraints or whatever you're looking for.
